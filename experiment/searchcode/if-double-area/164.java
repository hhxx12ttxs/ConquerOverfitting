/**
 * Abstract class to define common methods on edges.
 * We use an half-edge data structure to perform mesh traversal.  An half-edge
 * (red arrows) contains a link (black arrows) to its symmetric half-edge, a
 * link to the next half-edge in the same triangle, a link to its underlying
 * triangle and a local number within this triangle.  A triangle contains an
 * array of three vertices; by convention, in each triangle, edge <em>i</em> is
 * located at the opposite of vertex <em>i</em>.  Thus even if half-edges have
 * no links to vertices, they can be easily found; suppose that half-edge
 * <code>e</code> has local number <code>l</code> in triangle <code>tri</code>:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><code>e.origin()</code> is <code>tri.vertex[(l+1)%3]</code></li>
 *   <li><code>e.destination()</code> is <code>tri.vertex[(l-1)%3]</code></li>
 *   <li><code>e.apex()</code> is <code>tri.vertex[l]</code></li>
 * </ul>
 * <p align="center"><img src="doc-files/Mesh-2.png" alt="[Image of a simple mesh with triangles and half-edges]"/></p>
 *
 * <p>
 * For an half-edge <code>e</code>, <code>e.sym()</code> returns its symmetric
 * half-edge, if it does exist.  In this case, <code>e.sym().sym()</code> is
 * always <code>e</code>, and in images below a link between symmetric half-edges
 * is represented by a single double-headed arrow instead of two arrows.
 * Moreover, symmetric edges must have opposite directions (except for
 * <a href="#non-manifold">non-manifold</a> edges), or in other words
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *    <li><code>e.origin() == e.sym().destination()</code></li>
 *    <li><code>e.destination() == e.sym().origin()</code></li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Image below shows two triangles which cannot be linked together because their common
 * edge has the same direction in both triangles.
 * </p>
 * <p align="center"><img src="doc-files/AbstractHalfEdge-11.png" alt="[Image showing invalid symmetric edges]"/></p>
 *
 * <h2>Geometrical primitives</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * Consider <code>AbstractHalfEdge</code> edge <code>e</code> between vertices
 * <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, starting from <em>A</em>, in image below:
 * </p>
 * <p align="center"><img src="doc-files/AbstractHalfEdge-1.png" alt="[Drawing to illustrate geometrical primitives]"/></p>
 * <p>
 * The following methods can be applied to <code>e</code>:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *    <li><code>e.{@link #next}</code> and <code>e.{@link #prev}</code> get respectively next and previous
 *        edges in the same triangle <em>(ABC)</em> in a counterclockwise cycle.</li>
 *    <li><code>e.{@link #sym}</code> gets the opposite <code>AbstractHalfEdge</code>, in triangle <em>(BAF)</em>.</li>
 *    <li><code>e.{@link #nextOrigin}</code> returns next edge starting from the same origin <em>A</em>
 *        when cycling counterclockwise around <em>A</em>.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p><strong>Warning:</strong>
 * As {@link VirtualHalfEdge} instances are handles to edges and not physical objects, these methods
 * modify current instance.  Another set of methods is defined to apply these transformations to
 * another instance, so that current instance is not modified.
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *    <li><code>e.<a href="#next(org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.AbstractHalfEdge)">next</a>(f)</code> (resp.
 *        <code>e.<a href="#prev(org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.AbstractHalfEdge)">prev</a>(f)</code>)
 *        moves <code>f</code> to next (resp. previous) edge in the same triangle <em>(ABC)</em>
 *        in a counterclockwise cycle.</li>
 *    <li><code>e.<a href="#sym(org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.AbstractHalfEdge)">sym</a>(f)</code>
 *        moves <code>f</code> to opposite of <code>e</code>.</li>
 *    <li><code>e.<a href="#nextOrigin(org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.AbstractHalfEdge)">nextOrigin</a>(f)</code>
 *        moves <code>f</code> to next edge starting from the same origin <em>A</em> when
 *        cycling counterclockwise around <em>A</em>.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * For convenience, derived classes may also define the following methods, which
 * are combinations of previous ones:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *    <li><code>e.prevOrigin()</code> moves counterclockwise to the previous edge
 *        starting from the same origin.</li>
 *    <li><code>e.nextDest()</code> (resp. <code>e.prevDest()</code>) moves counterclockwise
 *        to next (resp. previous) edge with the same destination vertex <em>B</em>.</li>
 *    <li><code>e.nextApex()</code> (resp. <code>e.prevApex()</code>) moves counterclockwise
 *        to next (resp. previous) edge with the same apical vertex <em>C</em>.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Mesh Operations</h2>
 * <p>
 * These operations are abstract methods and are implemented by derived classes:
 * </p>
 * <dl>
 *   <dt><a href="#swap()"><code>swap</code></a></dt>
 *   <dd>Swaps an edge.  Return value has the same original and apical vertices as
 *       original edge.  Triangles and edges are modified, objects are not destroyed and
 *       inserted into mesh.
 *       <p align="center"><img src="doc-files/AbstractHalfEdge-4.png" alt="[Image showing edge swap]"/></p>
 *   </dd>
 *   <dt><a href="#split(org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.Mesh, org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.Vertex)"><code>split</code></a></dt>
 *   <dd>Splits a vertex to create a new edge.  In figure below, <em>A</em> is duplicated into <em>N</em>,
 *       and two new triangles are created.  Return value has the same original and apical vertices as
 *       original edge, and its destination vertex is <em>N</em>.
 *       <p><strong>Warning:</strong> This method does not check that new triangles are not inverted.</p>
 *       <p align="center"><img src="doc-files/AbstractHalfEdge-3.png" alt="[Image showing vertex split]"/></p>
 *   </dd>
 *   <dt><a href="#collapse(org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.Mesh, org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.Vertex)"><code>collapse</code></a></dt>
 *   <dd>Collapses an edge into a new point.  Triangles, edges and vertices are removed from mesh
 *       and replaced by new objects.  New point may be origin or destination points, or a new point.
 *       Return value has the new point as its origin, and its apex is the same as in original edge.
 *       When <em>N</em> is <em>A</em>,
 *       <code><a href="#collapse(org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.Mesh, org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.Vertex)">collapse</a></code>
 *       is the opposite of 
 *       <code><a href="#split(org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.Mesh, org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.Vertex)">split</a></code>.
 *       <p><strong>Warning:</strong> This method does not check that triangles are not inverted.
 *       Method <a href="#canCollapse(org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.Vertex)"><code>canCollapse</code></a>
 *       <strong>must</strong> have been called to ensure that this edge
 *       collapse is possible, otherwise errors may occur.  This method is not
 *       called automatically because it is sometimes costful.</p>
 *       <p align="center"><img src="doc-files/AbstractHalfEdge-2.png" alt="[Image showing edge collapse]"/></p>
 *   </dd>
 * </dl>
 * <p>
 * Return values have been chosen so that these methods always return an edge
 * which has the same apical vertex.  As will be explained below, they gracefully
 * work with boundaries and non-manifold meshes.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * These two methods may also be of interest when writing new algorithms:
 * </p>
 * <dl>
 *   <dt><a href="#canCollapse(org.jcae.mesh.amibe.ds.Vertex)"><code>canCollapse</code></a></dt>
 *   <dd>Tells whether an edge can be collapsed and replaced by the given vertex.</dd>
 *   <dt><a href="#checkNewRingNormals(double[])"><code>checkNewRingNormals</code></a></dt>
 *   <dd>Tells whether triangles become inverted if origin point is moved at
 *       given location.</dd>
 * </dl>
 *
 * <h2>Boundaries</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * In order to simplify mesh operations, outer triangles are added to opposite
 * side of free edges, by linking vertices on boundary to a special vertex
 * {@link Mesh#outerVertex} which represents a point at infinite.  With this
 * convention, all mesh edges have a symmetric edge.  On the other hand, all edges 
 * which have {@link Mesh#outerVertex} as an endpoint have no symmetric edges, so
 * in these special triangles, there is only one edge with a symmetric edge.
 * </p>
 * <p align="center"><img src="doc-files/AbstractHalfEdge-5.png" alt="[Drawing to illustrate outer triangles]"/></p>
 * <p>
 * All <code>AbstractHalfEdge</code> derived classes allow to set attributes on edges.
 * They are defined as bitwise OR values, these values are useful:
 * </p>
 * <dl>
 *   <dt><code>AbstractHalfEdge.BOUNDARY</code></dt>
 *   <dd>This edge is on a mesh boundary (either part of an outer triangle or of
 *       a regular triangle)
 *   <dt><code>AbstractHalfEdge.OUTER</code></dt>
 *   <dd>This edge is part of an outer triangle
 *   <dt><code>AbstractHalfEdge.NONMANIFOLD</code></dt>
 *   <dd>This edge is not manifold (see below)
 * </dl>
 * <p>
 * Other values, namely <code>AbstractHalfEdge.MARKED</code>, <code>AbstractHalfEdge.SWAPPED</code>
 * and <code>AbstractHalfEdge.QUAD</code> may be removed in future releases, please do not use them.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>For instance, image below is an excerpt of previous image into which edge attributes
 * are displayed: <code>O</code> represents <code>AbstractHalfEdge.OUTER</code>
 * attribute, <code>B</code> represents <code>AbstractHalfEdge.BOUNDARY</code> and <code>|</code>
 * means that attributes are combined.
 * </p>
 * <p align="center"><img src="doc-files/AbstractHalfEdge-6.png" alt="[Drawing to illustrate edge attributes]"/></p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Attributes are handled by these methods:
 * </p>
 * <dl>
 *   <dt>{@link #setAttributes}</dt>
 *   <dd>Combines edge attribute with method argument.</dd>
 *   <dt>{@link #clearAttributes}</dt>
 *   <dd>Combines edge attribute with 2-complement of method argument, which means that
 *       attributes passed as argument are reset.</dd>
 *   <dt>{@link #hasAttributes}</dt>
 *   <dd>Checks whether edge attribute contains any of attributes passed as method argument.</dd>
 * </dl>
 *
 * <p>
 * With these outer triangles, we can also loop around vertices even on mesh boundaries.
 * The {@link #nextOriginLoop} method behaves like {@link #nextOrigin} when edge is not
 * outer, and when it is outer, it turns clockwise until boundary is reached.  For instance
 * on image below, <code>a.nextOriginLoop()</code> returns <code>b</code>, 
 * <code>b.nextOriginLoop()</code> returns <code>o</code>,
 * <code>o.nextOriginLoop()</code> returns <code>d</code> and
 * <code>d.nextOriginLoop()</code> returns <code>a</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p align="center"><img src="doc-files/AbstractHalfEdge-7.png" alt="[Drawing to illustrate nextOriginLoop method]"/></p>
 * <p>
 * With <code>nextOriginLoop</code>, it is easy to loop around a vertex without
 * having to care about boundaries; a canonical way to process all inner triangles 
 * by looping around edge origin is:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 *   Vertex d = e.destination();
 *   do
 *   {
 *     if (!e.hasAttributes(AbstractHalfEdge.OUTER))
 *     {
 *       Triangle t = e.getTri();
 *       // Do something with t
 *     }
 *     e = e.nextOriginLoop();
 *   }
 *   while (e.destination() != d);
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Here is a more complete example to show how to process all neighbors of a manifold vertex:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 *   // This sample code only works with manifold vertices!
 *   Triangle t = (Triangle) o.getLink();
 *   AbstractHalfEdge e = t.getAbstractHalfEdge();
 *   if (e.destination() == o)
 *     e = e.next();
 *   else if (e.apex() == o)
 *     e = e.prev();
 *   // Now e is an edge starting from vertex o.
 *   Vertex d = e.destination();
 *   do
 *   {
 *     if (!e.hasAttributes(AbstractHalfEdge.OUTER)
 *         || e.hasAttributes(AbstractHalfEdge.BOUNDARY|AbstractHalfEdge.NONMANIFOLD))
 *     {
 *       Vertex v = e.destination();
 *       // Do something with v
 *     }
 *     e = e.nextOriginLoop();
 *   }
 *   while (e.destination() != d);
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2 id="non-manifold">Non-manifold edges</h2>
 * <p>
 * A non-manifold edge is bound to more than two triangles.  In image below, edges <code>(AB)</code>,
 * <code>(BC)</code> and <code>(CD)</code> belong to four triangles.
 * </p>
 * <p align="center"><img src="doc-files/AbstractHalfEdge-8.png" alt="[Image of a non-manifold mesh]"/></p>
 *
 * <p>
 * As with free edges, virtual triangles are added so that non-manifold edge has only one symmetric edge,
 * and this time it is tagged with <code>NONMANIFOLD</code> attribute.
 * Edge attributes are printed in blue for left shell:
 * </p>
 * <p align="center"><img src="doc-files/AbstractHalfEdge-9.png" alt="[Image showing edge attributes for a non-manifold mesh]"/></p>
 *
 * <p>
 * We explained that the two outer edges are not connected to other triangles,
 * so we have two free slots.  We use these two slots to build a circular
 * doubly-linked list to iterate over all half-edges connected together, as is
 * done with radial-edge data structure.  Here is an example, with an edge connected to three triangles; virtual triangles
 * are represented by dashed lines.
 * </p>
 * <p align="center"><img src="doc-files/AbstractHalfEdge-13.png" alt="[Non-manifold edge connected to three triangles]"/></p>
 * <p align="center"><img src="doc-files/AbstractHalfEdge-14.png" alt="[Virtual triangles and connections for a non-manifold edge connected to three triangles]"/></p>
 * <p>
 * All edges have only one symmetric edge.  But adjacency relations between virtual triangles (represented by dotted arrows)
 * are special, these half-edges are the only ones which do not necessarily satisfy these identities:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *    <li><code>e.origin() == e.sym().destination()</code></li>
 *    <li><code>e.destination() == e.sym().origin()</code></li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * The <a href="#fanIterator()"><code>fanIterator</code></a> method returns an iterator over all edges connected
 * to this one through such virtual triangles.  By convention, this iterator returns half-edges which are not outer.
 * In order to ease writing algorithms, this iterator is also defined on regular half-edges, and return only one
 * value which is this half-edge.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * How can we iterate over all neighbors of <code>A</code>?  If we look again at sample code above,
 * it is obvious that not all neighbors are caught.  We could try to ask non-manifold edges to the rescue,
 * it does not seem trivial.  A simpler solution is to store a list of all triangles connected to each vertex,
 * but it consumes lots of memory.  We call <em>triangle fan</em> the set of triangles which are visited
 * when calling {@link #nextOriginLoop} iteratively.  If vertex is manifold, all neighbors are then reached.
 * If not, we take another triangle which has not been visited yet, and repeat the same procedure until
 * all neighbors have been reached.  A good compromise is to take a single triangle by triangle fans, and they
 * are stored into a triangle array because topology is usually not modified and number of triangle fans does
 * not change.  It is easy to modify sample code above, put it into a method taking a triangle as argument,
 * call it with <code>o.getLink()</code> if it is a <code>Triangle</code> instance, otherwise loop over
 * <code>Triangle[]</code> and call this method for each <code>Triangle</code> instance.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Consider the same mesh as above, from which triangles <code>(ABE)</code>, <code>(CDF)</code> and their symmetric
 * ones have been removed.  Edges <code>(AB)</code> and <code>(CD)</code> are manifold, but <code>(BC)</code> is not.
 * Vertices <code>A</code> and <code>D</code> are manifold, but <code>B</code> and <code>C</code> and connected to
 * three triangle fans, while edge <code>(BC)</code> is connected to four triangles.  All mesh operations described
 * above can gracefully handle such geometries, the only problem is when we try to mesh a surface which is not
 * orientable.
 * </p>
 * <p align="center"><img src="doc-files/AbstractHalfEdge-10.png" alt="[Image showing a non-manifold edge bound to four triangles while its endpoints are bound to three triangle fans]"/></p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Non-manifold edges can also be used to handle ill-oriented meshes.  Two triangles which have opposite
 * orientations, as already shown in this image
 * </p>
 * <p align="center"><img src="doc-files/AbstractHalfEdge-11.png" alt="[Image showing invalid symmetric edges]"/></p>
 * <p>
 * can be linked together if we state that common edge is non-manifold, add two virtual triangles and link
