/**
 * Represents an exchange rate that allows {@link BigMoneyProvider} instances to be converted between amounts in
 * different {@link CurrencyUnit}s. Exchange rate is an object that holds data about the conversion rate, two
 * {@link CurrencyUnit}s, and optionally scale and rounding mode. It represents the following relationship:
 * 
 * <p>
 * 1 major unit of <strong><code>target currency</code></strong> = <strong><code>rate</code></strong> major units of
 * <strong><code>source currency</code></strong>.
 * </p>
 * 
 * 
 * The optional scale and rounding mode settings are used when rate has to be changed in response to an invoked method,
 * i.e. {@link #invert()}. When those settings are not provided when instances of this class are created defaults are
 * taken from {@link #DEFAULT_SCALE} and {@link ExchangeRate#DEFAULT_ROUNDING_MODE}. <br/>
 * Those settings are not used on creation - this means that if one creates an instance of ExchangeRate with scale 2 and
 * rate with more decimal places the given rate will be used initially, the scale would only be used only when certain
 * methods are invoked (i.e. {@link #invert()}. <br/>
 * An example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * ExchangeRate o1 = ExchangeRate
 * 		.of(new BigDecimal(&quot;1.2345&quot;), CurrencyUnit.USD, CurrencyUnit.EUR, 2, RoundingMode.HALF_UP);
 * ExchangeRate o2 = o1.invert();
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Instance {@code o1} uses rate 1.2345 for all calculations. Instance {@code o2} has the rate rounded and its scale is
 * set to 2, so the resulting rate is 0.81.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Instances of this class are immutable.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Two instances of this class are considered equal when both target and source currencies are the same and the rates
 * compare equal according to {@link BigDecimal#compareTo(BigDecimal)}. Current scale and rounding mode are not
 * considered while the comparison is performed.
 * </p>
 * 
 * // TODO should negative exchange rates be allowed? Basically it's reasonable that only positive values should be
 * // allowed; if one needs negative amounts one should provide a negative amount to convert.
