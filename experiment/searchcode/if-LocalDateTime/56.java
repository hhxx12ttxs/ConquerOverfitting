/**
 * A date-time with a zone offset from UTC in the ISO-8601 calendar system,
 * such as {@code 2007-12-03T10:15:30+01:00}.
 * <p>
 * {@code OffsetDateTime} is an immutable representation of a date-time with an offset.
 * This class stores all date and time fields, to a precision of nanoseconds,
 * as well as the offset from UTC. For example, the value
 * "2nd October 2007 at 13:45.30.123456789 +02:00" can be stored in an {@code OffsetDateTime}.
 * <p>
 * {@code OffsetDateTime} and {@link Instant} both store an instant on the time-line
 * to nanosecond precision. The main difference is that this class also stores the
 * offset from UTC. {@code Instant} should be used when you only need to compare the
 * object to other instants. {@code OffsetDateTime} should be used when you want to actively
 * query and manipulate the date and time fields, although you should also consider using
 * {@link ZonedDateTime}.
 * 
 * <h4>Implementation notes</h4>
 * This class is immutable and thread-safe.
