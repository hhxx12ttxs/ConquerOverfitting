/**
 * Implements jitter buffer.
 * 
 * A jitter buffer temporarily stores arriving packets in order to minimize
 * delay variations. If packets arrive too late then they are discarded. A
 * jitter buffer may be mis-configured and be either too large or too small.
 * 
 * If a jitter buffer is too small then an excessive number of packets may be
 * discarded, which can lead to call quality degradation. If a jitter buffer is
 * too large then the additional delay can lead to conversational difficulty.
 * 
 * A typical jitter buffer configuration is 30mS to 50mS in size. In the case of
 * an adaptive jitter buffer then the maximum size may be set to 100-200mS. Note
 * that if the jitter buffer size exceeds 100mS then the additional delay
 * introduced can lead to conversational difficulty.
