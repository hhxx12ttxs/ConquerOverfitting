//Generate consecutive primes
long p1 = primes.get(i);
long q1 = primes.get(i + 1);
//Here we know that sqrt(n) lies between p1 < sqrt(n) < q1
//So we use this fact to say that p1*p1 +1 <= n <= q1*q1 -1
long p = p1 * p1 + 1;
long q = q1 * q1 - 1;
//Obviously the upper bound cannot be higher than our preset N
