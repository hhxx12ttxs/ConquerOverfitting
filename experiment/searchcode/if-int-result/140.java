 * 
 * Style 12 is a type of machine parseable output that many of the FICS
 * interfaces use. The output is documented here for those who wish to write new
 * interfaces. Style 12 is also fully compatible with ICC (The Internet Chess
 * Club).
 * 
 * The data is all on one line (displayed here as two lines, so it will show on
 * your screen). Here is an example: [Note: the beginning and ending quotation
 * marks are *not* part of the data string; they are needed in this help file
 * because some interfaces cannot display the string when in a text file.] "
 * <12>rnbqkb-r pppppppp -----n-- -------- ----P--- -------- PPPPKPPP RNBQ-BNR B
 * -1 0 0 1 1 0 7 Newton Einstein 1 2 12 39 39 119 122 2 K/e1-e2 (0:06) Ke2 0"
 * 
 * This string always begins on a new line, and there are always exactly 31 non-
 * empty fields separated by blanks. The fields are:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * the string &quot; &lt;12&gt;&quot; to identify this line.
 * 
 * eight fields representing the board position. The first one is White's 8th
 * rank (also Black's 1st rank), then White's 7th rank (also Black's 2nd), etc,
 * regardless of who's move it is.
 * 
 * color whose turn it is to move (&quot;B&quot; or &quot;W&quot;)
 * 
 * -1 if the previous move was NOT a double pawn push, otherwise the chess board
 * file (numbered 0--7 for a--h) in which the double push was made
 * 
 * can White still castle short? (0=no, 1=yes) 
 * can White still castle long? 
 * can Black still castle short? 
 * can Black still castle long?
 * 
 * the number of moves made since the last irreversible move. (0 if last move
 * was irreversible. If the value is &gt;= 100, the game can be declared a draw due
 * to the 50 move rule.)
 * 
 * The game number
 * 
 * White's name 
 * Black's name
 * 
 * my relation to this game: -3 isolated position, such as for &quot;ref 3&quot; or the
 * &quot;sposition&quot; command -2 I am observing game being examined 2 I am the examiner
 * of this game -1 I am playing, it is my opponent's move 1 I am playing and it
 * is my move 0 I am observing a game being played
 * 
 * initial time (in seconds) of the match increment (In seconds) of the match
 * 
 * White material strength Black material strength
 * 
 * White's remaining time Black's remaining time
 * 
 * the number of the move about to be made (standard chess numbering -- White's
 * and Black's first moves are both 1, etc.)
 * 
 * verbose coordinate notation for the previous move (&quot;none&quot; if there were none)
 * [note this used to be broken for examined games]
 * 
 * time taken to make previous move &quot;(min:sec)&quot;.
 * 
 * pretty notation for the previous move (&quot;none&quot; if there is none)
 * 
 * flip field for board orientation: 1 = Black at bottom, 0 = White at bottom.
 * 
 * 1 If clock is ticking. 0 if it is not. The amount of lag that occured last
 * move in milliseconds. 0 if none.
 * 
 * </pre>
 * 
 * In the future, new fields may be added to the end of the data string, so
 * programs should parse from left to right.
