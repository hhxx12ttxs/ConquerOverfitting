* We also update the covariance matrix according to the next prediction:
* <p>
* P&#39; = FP(transp F)
* y becomes the difference between the move and what we expected:
* <p>
* y = z - Hx
* <p>
* UPDATE S
* <p>
* S is the covariance of the move, adding up the covariance in move space of the position and the covariance of the measurement:
