     * Nodes for event barrier to manage idle threads.  Queue nodes

     *
     * The event barrier has an event count and a wait queue (actually
     * a Treiber stack).  Workers are enabled to look for work when
     * the eventCount is incremented. If they fail to find work, they
     * may wait for next count. Upon release, threads help others wake
     * up.
     *
     * Synchronization events occur only in enough contexts to
     * maintain overall liveness:
     *
     *   - Submission of a new task to the pool
     *   - Resizes or other changes to the threads array
     *   - pool termination
     *   - A worker pushing a task on an empty queue
     *
     * The case of pushing a task occurs often enough, and is heavy
     * enough compared to simple stack pushes, to require special
     * handling: Method signalWork returns without advancing count if
     * the queue appears to be empty.  This would ordinarily result in
     * races causing some queued waiters not to be woken up. To avoid
     * this, the first worker enqueued in method sync rescans for
     * tasks after being enqueued, and helps signal if any are
     * found. This works well because the worker has nothing better to
     * do, and so might as well help alleviate the overhead and
     * contention on the threads actually doing work.  Also, since
     * event counts increments on task availability exist to maintain
     * liveness (rather than to force refreshes etc), it is OK for
     * callers to exit early if contending with another signaller.
