/**
 * The Coptic calendar system.
 * <p>
 * This chronology defines the rules of the Coptic calendar system.
 * This calendar system is primarily used in Christian Egypt.
 * Dates are aligned such that {@code 0001AM-01-01 (Coptic)} is {@code 0284-08-29 (ISO)}.
 * <p>
 * The fields are defined as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>era - There are two eras, the current 'Era of the Martyrs' (AM) and the previous era (BEFORE_AM).
 * <li>year-of-era - The year-of-era is the same as the proleptic-year for the current AM era.
 * <li>proleptic-year - The proleptic year is the same as the year-of-era for the
 *  current AM era. For the BEFORE_AM era, years have negative values.
 * <li>month-of-year - There are 13 months in a Coptic year, numbered from 1 to 13.
 * <li>day-of-month - There are 30 days in each of the first 12 Coptic months, numbered 1 to 30.
 *  The 13th month has 5 days, or 6 in a leap year, numbered 1 to 5 or 1 to 6.
 * <li>day-of-year - There are 365 days in a standard Coptic year and 366 in a leap year.
 *  The days are numbered from 1 to 365 or 1 to 366.
 * <li>leap-year - Leap years occur every 4 years.
 * </ul>

 * <h4>Implementation notes</h4>
 * This class is immutable and thread-safe.
