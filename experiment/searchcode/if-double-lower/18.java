/**
 * Data concerning a value with a pair of associated values that determine its
 * lower and upper limits. Also, step and page increments as well as a page
 * size are available. Adjustment is not a Widget itself; Adjustments are used
 * by certain Widgets such as SpinButton, VScale and HScale, etc. More
 * commonly, though, you encounter Adjustment objects as the mechanism
 * controlling the position of VScrollbars and HScrollbars as seen in
 * TreeView, TextView, and other Containers packed into a
 * {@link ScrolledWindow}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A single Adjustment object can be shared by more than one Widget. Thus if
 * you need to have multiple Widgets behave similarly with respect to say
 * vertical scrolling, a single Adjustment object will do.
 * 
 * <p>
 * An Adjustment does <i>not</i> update its own values. Associated Widgets
 * that use an Adjustment call the <code>emitValueChanged()</code> method on
 * the widget, causing a <code>Adjustment.ValueChanged</code> signal which in
 * turn is what drives GTK's internal scrolling behaviours. You can react to
 * it too.
