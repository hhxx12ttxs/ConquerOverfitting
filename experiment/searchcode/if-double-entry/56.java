 * value at an entry on a mutable sparse vector, use
 * {@link MutableSparseVector#set(VectorEntry, double)}.
 * This design allows the same VectorEntry to work for both Mutable
 * and Immutable vectors, since the Immutable vectors can safely
 * return the VectorEntry knowing it cannot change the (immutable)
 * values, while the set operation on Mutable vectors allows the
 * element to be changed.
