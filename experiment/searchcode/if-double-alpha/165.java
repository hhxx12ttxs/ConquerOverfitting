/**
 * Carry out drawing operations with the Cairo Graphics library. The current
 * Context contains the state of the rendering engine, including the
 * co-ordinates of as yet undrawn elements.
 * 
 * <h2>Constructing</h2>
 * 
 * Graphics will be rendered to the Surface specified when you construct the
 * Context:
 * <ul>
 * <li>If creating an image to be written to a file, start with an
 * {@link ImageSurface}, do your drawing, and then use Surface's writeToPNG()
 * to output your image.
 * <li>If drawing to the screen in a user interface application, construct a
 * Context using the underlying GDK Window in your Widget's
 * {@link org.gnome.gtk.Widget.ExposeEvent Widget.ExposeEvent}, and do your
 * drawing there.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * See the links above for examples of each use case.
 * 
 * <h2>Drawing Operations</h2>
 * 
 * Context has numerous methods allowing you to draw shapes, patterns, and
 * images to the Surface you are drawing on. These operations are all quite
 * low level, but give you very fine grained control over what is drawn and
 * where.
 * 
 * <p>
 * It is somewhat traditional to call your Context <code>cr</code>.
 * 
 * <p>
 * All of the methods on Context take arguments of type <code>double</code> to
 * represent co-ordinates, angles, colours, transparency levels, etc. Colours
 * are represented as values between <code>0.0</code> and <code>0.1</code>,
 * for example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * cr.setSource(1.0, 0.0, 0.0);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * for solid red. In the case of co-ordinates, you can simply specify the
 * pixel address you wish to move to or draw to: <img src="Context-line.png"
 * class="snapshot">
 * 
 * <pre>
 * cr.moveTo(10, 10);
 * cr.lineTo(90, 50);
 * cr.stroke();
 * </pre>
 * 
 * where stroke draws the current path with the current line thickness.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Various other drawing operations are done by creating a shape and then
 * filling it in: <img src="Context-rectangle.png" class="snapshot">
 * 
 * <pre>
 * cr.rectangle(30, 20, 60, 60);
 * cr.fill();
 * </pre>
 * 
 * and so on.
