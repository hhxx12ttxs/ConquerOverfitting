/**
 * The rules defining how the zone offset varies for a single time-zone.
 * <p>
 * The rules model all the historic and future transitions for a time-zone.
 * {@link ZoneOffsetTransition} is used for known transitions, typically historic.
 * {@link ZoneOffsetTransitionRule} is used for future transitions that are based
 * on the result of an algorithm.
 * <p>
 * The rules are loaded via {@link ZoneId} and {@link ZoneRulesGroup} and
 * are specific to a group, region and version. The same rules may be shared
 * between multiple versions, regions or even groups.
 * <p>
 * Serializing an instance of {@code ZoneRules} will store the entire set
 * of rules. It does not store the group, region or version as they are not
 * part of the state of this object.
 * <p>
 * A rule implementation may or may not store full information about historic
 * and future transitions, and the information stored is only as accurate as
 * that supplied to the implementation by the rules provider.
 * Applications should treat the data provided as representing the best information
 * available to the implementation of this rule.
 * 
 * <h4>Implementation notes</h4>
 * This interface must be implemented with care to ensure other classes operate correctly.
 * All implementations that can be instantiated must be final, immutable and thread-safe.
 * Subclasses should be Serializable wherever possible.
