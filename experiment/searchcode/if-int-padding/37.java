/**
 * Base class for Containers which organize a variable number of Widgets into
 * a rectangular area. This is either a single row of child Widgets (in the
 * case of {@link HBox HBox}), or a single column (for the case of
 * {@link VBox VBox}). All the children of a Box are allocated one dimension
 * in common, being the height of a row, or the width of a column,
 * respectively.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Nested combinations of VBoxes and HBoxes are the cornerstone layout
 * technique used in GTK. A top level VBox to organize a Window is followed by
 * a sequence Widgets, many of which will end up being HBoxes, and each of
 * those in turn might contain further Containers. This sort of thing gives
 * you great flexibility when laying out your user interface.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Boxes are also used to enable grouping of Widgets at very small scales as
 * well. For example, the ok Button you see in every GNOME dialog is actually
 * an Image holding the icon and a Label with the text "OK" packed into an
 * HBox; the HBox is what was actually added to the Button!
